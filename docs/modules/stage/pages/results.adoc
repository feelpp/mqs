==  A solenoidal magnet

The normalized computed electric potential, current and magnetic field at the Origin are plotted bellow:

We use the expected values of the applied electric potential, current and magnetic field for the transient regime (aka t):

[options="header"]
|===
|  | Value | Unit
| stem:[V] | 1 | V
| stem:[I] | 135069 | A
| stem:[B_z(\mathbf{O})] | 0.944 | T
|===

Here is what we get on feelpp using the block-form program, after normalization by the above values.

To obtain these results, use the command :

[source,cmd]
----
mpirun -np 1 feelpp_mqs_form --config-file cases/quart-turn/quart-turn.cfg --gmsh.hsize 0.05 --pc-type gasm --ksp-monitor=1
----

This will produce a csv file in the feel folder associated with this case.

To obtain these results, use the command :
