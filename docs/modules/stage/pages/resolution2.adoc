= Resolution with non-linear parameter

We will now attempt a second approach. 
In reality, the parameters stem:[\sigma] and stem:[k] depend on the temperature in the following way:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
\sigma(T) = \frac{\sigma_0}{1+\alpha(T-T_0)} \\
k(T)=\frac{k_0}{1+\alpha(T-T_0)}\frac{T}{T_0}
\end{align}
++++

It is therefore necessary to update them every step of the time.
To do this we will proceed as follows:

At time 0, stem:[\sigma_0] and stem:[k_0] are fixed and then the equations mqs are solved. 
Then, a fixed point method, here picard, 
is applied to approach the non-linear terms of the heat equation until a satisfactory relative error is obtained. 
Finaly stem:[\sigma] and stem:[k] are updated for the following time step.

== Implementation under feelpp

The code is relatively close to that of the previous part, there are only a few small changes :

We define the tolerance for picard iterations, as well as the maximum number of iterations tolerated.

[source,cpp]
----
double dt = doption(_name = "ts.time-step");
double tmax = doption(_name = "ts.time-final");
----

We define stem:[\sigma] in another way: We update the value of T at each time step with the previous value. 

[source,cpp]
----
auto sigma = material.getScalar("sigma","T",idv(prevT));
----

where prevT is stem:[T] at previous time.

We also do the same for k in heat part :

[source,cpp]
----
auto k = material.getScalar("k","T",idv(prevT));
----

Then, after solving the two mqs equations and calculating J, 
we start the picard loop for the heat equation 

[source,cpp]
----
picardIter = 0;
while(incrT > tol )
{
    Feel::cout << "Picard iter num = " << picardIter+1 << std::endl;
    if (picardIter > maxiter)
    {
        Feel::cout << "Picard maxiter reach" << std::endl;
        break;
    }
    ...
----

After calculating T, the error L2 is calculated:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
err(T) = \frac{||T-prevT||_2}{||prevT||_2}
\end{equation*}
++++

[source,cpp]
----
    incrT = normL2(_range=markedelements(mesh,range),_expr=idv(T)-idv(prevT));
    incrT /= normL2(_range=markedelements(mesh,range),_expr=idv(prevT));
----

And we make this loop until the error is smaller than the set tolerance. 
Note that stem:[\sigma] and stem:[k] are well updated at each iteration.

After that, we go to the time t+1 and start again. 

== Results 

We are interested in the same case as the linear model, i.e. the model with a single magnet. A simulation is carried out over a period of 12 seconds, by increasing the voltage stem:[U] up to stem:[U_{max}=0.25] at stem:[t=1], then a plateau of 9 seconds before the voltage stops at stem:[t=10].

The cfg and json files can be found on the heat branch, in srs/cases/mqsheat/ and are named heatheatpicard.

After simulation using stem:[dt = 0.1], here are the results:

Here is the evolution of the temperature versus time compared with the linear case :

First, we find that the temperature at the end of the plateau in the linear case is higher than in the non-linear case.
This is probably explained by the fact that the stem:[\sigma] conductivity will decrease with temperature, as we can see from the stem:[\sigma] formula, so the second member of the heat equation representing the joule losses will be lower, hence a decrease in temperature.

Let's display the temperature and the magnetic field in the non-linear case :

image:mqsheat/nonlin.png[geometry,50%]

Let's now compare this to the linear case : 

image:mqsheat/lin.png[geometry,50%]

We can see that in the non-linear case, a peak is formed in t=1 for the magnetic field. The magnetic field thus reaches its maximum at t=1, before falling back to a limit value. In the linear case, the limit value is read directly at the end of the plateau.

Let's further compare I in the linear and non-linear case :

image:mqsheat/It.png[geometry,50%]

In order to analyze, let's additionally display I and B in the linear and non-linear cases, normalized with respect to the linear case

image:mqsheat/all.png[geometry,50%]

From this comparison we can see two things.

Firstly, the intensity and the magnetic field correspond perfectly in the linear and non-linear case, which is an expected result because I is linear with respect to B.
Secondly, and most interestingly, we find a peak for the magnetic field and intensity in the non-linear case in stem:[t=1].
This peak is explained by the fact that in the non-linear case, the expected intensity is lower which is confirmed on the graph, and therefore the resistance will be stronger. 
The peak therefore represents the variation in resistance between the linear and non-linear case, which occurs in stem:[t=1], which is expected.
