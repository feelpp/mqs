= Acknowledgments 

I would like to thank Christophe Trophime for having offered me this internship, and for having supervised me during this one, especially with the current situation.
I thank him for having taken the time to answer my many questions, for having explained to me many things that I didn't understand, that I didn't know, and for having made me aware of the methodology and the rigour that one needs to have in order to move forward conscientiously in a project.
I would also like to thank Christophe Prud'homme and Vincent Chabannes for helping me on issues related to feelpp and its understanding. 
Finally, I would like to thank Romain Hild, for answering all my questions about the technical aspects of feelpp.
