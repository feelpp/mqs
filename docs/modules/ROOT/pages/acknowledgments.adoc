= Acknowledgments 

Above all, I would like to thank Christophe Trophime for having proposed this project, 
for having supervised me during this one, for having been able to answer my questions 
and for having been able to help me to understand the subject as well as the theoretical 
bases necessary to the comprehension of this one. I would also like to thank Christophe Prud'homme, 
for assigning me to this project, for supervising me throughout it, and for helping me learn the basics 
of feelpp development. Finally, I also want to thank Romain Hild, for answering many of my questions about 
feelpp development when I was in trouble.
