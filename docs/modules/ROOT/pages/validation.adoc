== Introduction
Two simple test cases are used to validate the formulation:

* a single magnet,
* a set of 2 magnets.

We will consider simple geometries for the magnets. They are
modeled as rectangular cross section torus. This allows us to 
derive analytical expressions for the resistance stem:[R] and inductances stem:[L]
of the magnets. For each case, we will model the powering and 
a powerfailure. The computed total current flowing into the magnets
will be compared to the results obtained by a simple equivalent stem:[RL] circuit.
The circuit may be either modeled by a simple ODE solver or using analytical methods 
(aka exponential Matrices). For other quantities, we will compared our simulation
results with other Finite Element Solver. We have chosen http://getdp.info/[getdp] 
with a MQS formulation for axisymetric geometries.

NB: getdp model and test geometry are accessible here. To reproduce the results follow the procedure in this appendix.

=== Setup

The magnet is centered on the origin of the cylindrical frame as shown bellow.

=== Resistance stem:[R] and Self Inductance stem:[L]

The resistance is defined as the ration of the applied electrical potential difference over the total current. In case of a rectangular cross section stem:[ (r_1,r_2) \times (z_1,z_2) ] torus, we can show that:

[stem]
++++
R = \frac{2 \pi r_1 \rho}{r_1 ln(r_2/r_1)\,(z_2-z_1)}
++++

with stem:[\rho=1/\sigma] the resistivity of the material composing the torus. For details on this expression, see feelpp electric toolbox test case.

As for the self-inductance, we recall the defintion of the stored magnetic energy:

[stem]
++++
E = \frac{1}{2} L I^2 = \frac{1}{2} \int_\mathbf{R^3} \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{H}\, d\Omega
++++

to continue...

=== Equivalent circuit model

From a macroscopic point of view, the studied system is simply equivalent to a stem:[RL] circuit modeled by:

[stem]
++++
U(t) = R I(t) + L \, \frac{dI}{dt}
++++

== 2 solenoidal magnets

For sake of simplicity, we consider 2 solenoid magnets similar to the one described in previous section stacked as shown bellow.

=== Mutual Inductance stem:[M]

Obviously, the 2 magnets have the same resistance and self-inductance as they have the same geometry and are made of the same material. We only need then
to compute the so-called mutual inductance stem:[M].

As before, we start wih the stored magnetic energy stem:[E] of the system:

[stem]
++++
E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_k L_k I_k^2 + \sum_k \sum_{l \neq k} M_{k,l} I_k I_l 
++++

to continue...

=== Equivalent circuit model

The equivalent circuit is this time similar to a transformer circuit. Thus, it may be modeled as:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
U_1(t) &=& R_1 I_1(t) + L_1 \, \frac{dI_1}{dt}+ M\,\frac{dI_2}{dt}, \\
U_2(t) &=& R_2 I_2(t) + M\, \frac{dI_1}{dt}+ L_2\,\frac{dI_2}{dt}
\end{align}
++++

In our case, we have stem:[R_1=R_2] and stem:[L_1=L_2].
